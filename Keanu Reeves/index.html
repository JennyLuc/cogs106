		<h2> Tree Map Genre vs. Revenue </h2>
	
		<p>
		In the Tree map, each section represents a genre of the 150 movies that Keanu Reeves has participated <br>
		in. Each sections' size is based on the revenue that the movie brings in. If a movie has multiple genres, <br>
		then the revenue is divided evenly among the genres. It would have been better if rather than a list of <br>
		genres that a movie represents, that there is a single genre that the movie best represents as, since <br>
		not all genres listed are weighted equally in the movie.

		<h2>Radar Chart</h2>

		<p>
		Keanu Reeves has starred in many movies, but four of his top known films include The Matrix, The Speed, <br>
		Point Break, and The Matrix Reloaded. Although all these movies are great on their own, I decided to <br>
		create a radar chart for each of these movies judging on the factors of ratings, ratings count, box office <br>
		revenue, release year, and runtime. In a radar chart, if all edges are able to hit the end of the circle/graph <br>
		it would represent how well movie/subject/object is. Unfortunately matplotlib would change the axis of the <br>
		radar chart where if the movie had its highest rating of a 3, the maximum of the circle would be 3 even though <br>
		the max scaling is 5. This would skew
