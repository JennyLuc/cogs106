As stated in class, Professor Powell did a great job in having us experience the Dunning-Kruger effect. In the end of the day and homework, despite all the technical work, the best lesson that stuck to me the most was the Dunning-Kruger effect as I heavily experienced it in this assignment. Having three homework due the same day and traveling to the Bay Area for a dragonboat race in the weekend, I was limited with my time on my assignments already. This assignment in particular I needed to spend much more time than my other assignments and it was harder than I predicted. It was my first time having an incomplete assignment despite pulling an all nighter for the assignment. I was able to complete part of the assignment, however did not have enough time to figure out the pie chart, bar chart, and dynamic legend. I was able to get the general idea of the charts generation, price, and temperature, however I was unable to capture the small details of the example that was given. There were some parts where although I put in a certain code, the charts do not change accordingly, like the border around the title and charts. I heavily relied on Highchart's documentations and Stack Overflow throughout the assignment.
